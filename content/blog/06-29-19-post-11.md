I'll finally get to go to A.A. meetings on Monday because I'll be off my two-week blackout period.  I need to see if there are any A.A. or N.A. Tech related meetups. I want to check into that.

I really haven't experienced any cravings since I've been here. I've been triggered on several occasions but I've had zero cravings.  Maybe not having stuff is not as scary as I had made it out to be.  I know I didn't like the withdrawal symptoms from when I was doing cocaine and I've been adraif of experiencing that with Meth.  But I don't think I ever did enough Meth to develop cravings.  I think it was more habitual than anything else.

I've really thought about running for the hills the last few days but I think that was based more on circumstantial factors than about wanting to go and use.  I think that even if I got out of here right now my first instinct wouldn't be to go and use.

I guess it's time I start doing my homework for Step 1.  I'm supposed to have it done for Monday when I meet with my Counselor Miss A again for a 1-on-1.  I already did the reading and have reached the point where I'm supposed to figure out what it means to me.

This place isn't great but it's not the worst in the world either.  I think we have a cool group of girls in the house right now.  I hope I get to move upstairs with Becky soon, I would like that.
