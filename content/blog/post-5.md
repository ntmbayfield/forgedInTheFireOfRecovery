I survived my first week here.  Maybe I was supposed to wind up here.  I have a connection to this place that I wasn't even aware.  My Mom ran a YMCA youth-offender program out of this building before I was even born and she met my Dad, whose construction company had its office across the street, when she needed to have some modifications done to the building to bring it up to code.  I guess they prepared this place for me to get my life togther without even knowing why.  It's amazing how some things come full circle.

In group this morning, we talked about triggers.  I think most of my triggers are feelings or situations more than people, places and things.  For example: feeling bored, having a fight with my Mom, being tired or lonely.  But I think more than anything that using had become a habit, something I did because the people around me were doing it, not because I was having cravings.  I used to hate the thought of running out of stuff more than anything else and would ration the small amount of stuff I had left more and more so that I would never run out.  It was like a safety net.  Or as long as I had something, even if it was the tiniest amount, I felt okay because I knew it was there.

I've always been able to use my intelligence to manipulate or cheat the system.  I was able to beat the Urine Analysis(UA) test system for court by using fake pee.  It would have been possible to do that here too (I think), but I've decided that I don't want to do that.  I'm willing to try being clean and sober for the first time in 7 seven years.  That's how long its's been since I've been clean and sober for any real length of time, and back then I think the longest period of sobriety that I had would have been two or three weeks.

I've noticed the dark circles under my eyes have been going away.  The fine lines and wrinkles under my eyes have also been lessening.  I miss my friends and my doggies more than anything but hopefully Mom can bring Bear Bear and Noodles to visit next weekend.  The thought of going 3-months without seeing them breaks my heart.  I love them so much! I want puppy kisses so much it hurts.  Bear Bear gives me the sweetest little kisses on the nose when he's happy to see me.

I miss my friend Wendell from coding school.  He brightens up my life in so many ways.  I didn't even tell him I was going to rehab.  He's always been a true friend to me and supportive of my career as a web developer and just me as a person.  Plus, we always have a great time together no matter what we're doing.  He's one of the few people in my social circle who I've never used around and would never use around.  The same goes for my other classmates from school.  Maybe I need to reconnect with more of them or meet new people at coding events and meetups.

For lunch today, we had a whole buffet of salads.  It was great.  My favorite one was a fruit salad made with jicama, mango, peaches, honeydew and pineapple with a little bit of tamarind spice added to the juice.

I did my makeup today and my hair.  I'm not crying at the drop of a hat anymore or at least not as much. I don't know what's going on with me and my inability to regulate crying.  [At this point, I would break out into tears at least twice a group and we had at least three groups every morning; and sporadically throughout the rest of the day.] . Anytime I'm feeling overly emotional I just start balling uncontrollably.

I miss Wellsey who always makes me laugh and who tells other people that I'm the most amazing human being he's ever met.  I miss talking to him, his fierce loyalty and that special hinky magic that he possesses.

I miss Simon, my modern day Samurai, who was willing to to go to battle for me even when I wasn't sure where his loyalties lay.  Who's tried to make up for mistakes he made in the past and has grown enough to stop trying to control what I'm doing even if he doesn't like it.  But still doesn't quite realize that I'm not from the streets and that people, specifically interacting and talking with them, still puzzles me far more than books and logical things.

I miss Nick who I've tried to be a real friend to.  I miss getting to be his confidante. I miss us ditching everybody else for a few hours and all the B.S. and drama of everyday life to run away to the secret "Batcave" and go swimming at the pool where Mom lives.  

I miss Mike who appreciates my evil genius tendencies and the kind heart that dwells in the same body.  The other person who I can count on to vet the people around me and see whether their intentions towards me are good or bad.  Because I'm just not that built that way and being manipulative doesn't come naturally to me.  I accept people at face value and tend to wear my heart on my sleeve.  

I miss 23, my fairy godmother, who's been the magical translator, mediator and bridge of communication between Mom and I.  Her name for me is 22.

I liked one of the things that I read this week that talked about the fact that you don't have to hit "rock bottom" to begin recovery.  I think my "rock bottom" would have been when I was doing cocaine 7-years ago.  A large part of that group's handout was related to Acceptance.  The parts of the handout that most resonated with me included:
  -"Entering treatment is the first act of acceptance.  It cannot be the only one.  Recovery is an ongoing process of accepting that substance abuse is more powerful than you are."
  -"Admitting that you have a problem and seeking help are not weaknesses.  Does getting treatment for diabetes or a heart condition mean that you are a weak-willed person?"
  -"People who accept the reality of substance dependence to the greatest degree benefit the most in recovery.  Those who do not fight with the idea that they have a substance use disorder are the ones who ultimately are the most successful in recovery.  The only way to be successful in recovery and get control of your problem is first to admit that it has control over you."
