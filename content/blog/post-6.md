I miss Michael from Los Angeles who I've known since I was 20-years old and has been in love with me ever since.  

I miss Brandon, but I think Sky might have turned him against me.  So, I don't know if we're going to be friends after this but I hope so.

I've manages to make it through a whole 7 days here at Chrysalis.  It felt like the end of the world when I had to come here but the ability to adapt to change is part of what makes us human.  

Emotions/feelings include: nervous, curious, rambunctious.
My motivation level is a 7. (If I survived one week of this place, then I can survive another week).
What coping skills did I use last week? Readin, crying, self-care, journaling.

I decided I'm going to stop wearing the workout outfits so much and go back to dressing more like I normally do, business-casual.  I think I only packed all-black gym outfits as a silent sign of protest about coming here and as a way of showing I'm mourning my old life.

One of my roommates commented that she really liked something I said and was going to write it down.  The comment I made was in regards to skincare but has a deeper meaning as well.  I think what I said was "What you put on the top(I was referring to make-up) isn't going to matter if you haven't taken care of what's underneath first(I was referring to having a skincare routine).

I feel angry, deceived and lied to by my Counselor Miss A who I spoke to on Saturday night and said that I was going to have my 1-on-1 meeting with her on Monday, today, even if it meant pulling me out of class.  But it's already dinner time and no meeting.  I'm trying not to let myself go down the path of the 13 common cognitive distortions, like #3: Shoulds (like Counselors should do what they say they are going to), #12: Fallacy of Fairness (I've been here for a week and haven't met with my counselor once), #9: Overpersonalizing (Taking it personally that Miss A didn't meet with me today when it most likely has nothing to do with me), #5: Negativity Bias (I prepared for a meeting today mentally and physically that now isn;t going to happen and I'm upset that I'm going to have to do it all over again).

Coping skills: I went and knocked on the door to the Counselor's office in the building next door which Miss L answered.  She told me not to worry about it that we would meet sometime this week, which I didn't like because I went all of last week without talking to anyone.  I don't want to do that again.  I told her that sometime this week was a little vague and could I have a specific day.  She replied that we could mee tomorrow.

I hate that there's nothing here to punch.  I really want a punching bag.  I felt better after kicking one of the trees in the courtyard a few times.  But I may boycott dinner because I'm that angry.

I know it's not the end of the world but I'm still upset about it.

I'm trying to use good coping skills by journaling about my emotions and clarifying my feelings, so I can look at the situation objectively and reach a conclusion about how I would like things to be handled differently next time.

If this situation were to occur again, I would like to get a phone call from my counselor informing me that things have changed and letting me know what day our meeting has been rescheduled for.

I know I don't hear voices, I'm not schizophrenic, I don't have multiple personality disorder and I don't even have a formal dual-diagnosis yet.  I'm curently classifed as an "Unspecified Mood Disorder."  Thus, I'm sure I rate pretty low on the triage scale but by the same token I won't ever get an actual diagnosis if I don't talk to my counselor either.

I got the best therapy ever tonight from two of the other girls.  But let me start at the beginning which means when we tried to go on a walk as a group and I got triggered by the fact that we were one block away from a place where I used to get high at and do crime.  At least I didn't feel tempted to go off from the group and go use.

When we came back from the walk, we had our own A.A, meeting in the living room. It started by all of us taking turns reading paragraphs from a story in "The Big Book" and then discussing what it meant to us. But even after all of that, we still had 30 minutes of group left.  So Cassie came up with a question for everyone to go around and answer, at which point Rachel turned to me and said "Do you wanna start?"  I don't even remember what the exact question I was supposed to answer was.  But I wound up becoming the de-facto speaker for that night and sharing my story with the girls.  I talked about how I had spent the last several years in a downwards spiral of using, my somewhat sobriety after doing an outpatient program in San Francisco 7-years ago, how I was introduced to alcohol and cocaine by a close family friend when I was 17(and who also sexually abused me), how I came to be at Chrysalis and whether I more mad at my Mom or myself for having to enter rehab, and why I was in recovery and doing this program.  I started off by reading a brief excerpt of a story found on page 512 of "The Big Book."  

I also spent 2-hours today reading the first part of "The Big Book" while I waiting at the doctor's office.  Mostly,it talked about the history of Alcoholics Anonymous and the origins of the group.  But I hadn't actually read any of the members' stories until tonight.
