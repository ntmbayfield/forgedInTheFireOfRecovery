To do list: Do laundry, get pass for going to get TB test done and pickup contacts, ask Mom to bring me some flip flops and let her know that if she wants to come visit over the weekend she doesn't have to come to group tonight but just needs to talk to my counselor over the phone.

Emotions/feelings include: cautiously optimistic.
My intention of being is not be discouraged by the migraines I've been having and to make it through another week here.
My motivation level is a 7.
What do I want to do this summer? I want to go swimming and work on my recovery.

I also want to start on my homework from my Counselor Miss A and keep reading "The Big Book."  I had a good 1-on-1 with her yesterday.  Finally.  Apparently, Miss E (the director of the program), was surprised I was still here based on how traumatic my intake session had been.
